# Tumor-Segmentation-of-Ultrasound-Breast-Images
By Alan http://alanpeng.wang
## Introduction

The segmentation of ultrasonic images of breast tumors is very important for medical diagnosis and artificial intelligence landing on medical images. In this repository, four different tumor segmentation models have been implemented based on previous studies, and the advantages and disadvantages of these models have been analyzed from the four aspects of segmentation effect, operation rate, pretreatment effect and generalization ability, which can help readers quickly understand the difficulties in ultrasonic image segmentation of breast tumors and the advantages and disadvantages of some algorithms.

## How to start

- Firstly, you should download all the files or download the Matlab library support from  https://www.tamps.cinvestav.mx/~wgomez/downloads.html.

- Secondly, as the hint says, you are supposed to run the RUN_ME_FIRST.m first.

- Thirdly, as you can see, the folder ***Experiments*** contains four folders and each folder contains one model. You can run the example(i) to test the model. Before you run, please check to add all the path or you will need to recreate the lacking .m file. 

- Lastly, you can refer to the folder ***Reports*** if you still have something that you don't understand.
